This repository contains a Java-based e-commerce application that simulates the core functionality of a real-world online shopping platform. It includes a structured product catalog, shopping cart management using the Singleton design pattern, order processing with unique order ID generation, simulated payment methods, product filtering, and order tracking. The project is built using fundamental Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces, and packages, along with a service-based architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability. It serves as a practical demonstration of how OOP principles and design patterns can be applied to develop a clean, extensible, and realistic e-commerce system.
